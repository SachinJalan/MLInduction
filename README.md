The solution for Question 1 is in the Paper Review.pdf
The solution to question 2 is in the model selection pdf
The solution to question 3 is in 2 parts, the theoritical answers are in the gaussian processes.pdf and the code for the same is in the GaussianProcess.ipynb file
The solution to 4th question of implementing GAN is in the GAN_Toy_Example.ipynb file which tries to generate a cosine function from noise.
The GAN code is referenced from web, the link is provided in the notebook.
